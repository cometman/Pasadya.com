				Danielle Selby is the designer and artist behind Pasadya. As a
				recent graduate of Texas Tech University with an undergraduate and
				graduate degree in interior design, Danielle gravitates toward
				functional designs with simplicity and beauty in mind, every once in
				a while mixed with humor. <br /> <br />She is in love with
				painting, transforming old, drab furniture into loved household
				items, designing heartfelt cards to spread joy, and branding
				business images, to name a few. <br /> <br />Pasadya was created
				as an outlet for Daneille to share her love for design-related
				products and practices. To keep things fresh, products at Pasadya
				are updated often, so make sure to check in to see what&#39;s new! <br />
				<br />Hope you enjoy your visit to Pasadya! <br />
